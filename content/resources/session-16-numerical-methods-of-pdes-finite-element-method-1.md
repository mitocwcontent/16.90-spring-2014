**Description:** This abbreviated session begins to introduce the finite element method for 1-dimenional diffusion, including key ideas and its history. Due to technical difficulties, the video ends after the audio fails at around 14:45.

**Instructor:** Karen Willcox

The recording quality of this video is the best available from the source.

NOTE: Videos for the next several classes, Sessions 17â€“20, are not available.
